How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	it saved my time and tedious work i had to do.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

1.It could help me restore to previous working system
2.reuse code from pervious versions to new projects




What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros: gives powe to user to commit when needed
cons: have to do it manually

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

so as if changes are made in many files in the repository , all of those are saved.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log will give all the files in repository with its commit id
	git diff wiil give defference between two commit ids



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	It will enable me making fearless during commiting since I can revert at any commit.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	now that my terminal is set i'll like to use it for backupping all my project files using git in future. i'm exited!!!
